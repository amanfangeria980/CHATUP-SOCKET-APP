- Our server has a circuit named "io"
- Now the circuit has multiple socketss or plugs attached to it (or clients attached to it) and each socket has a socket ID
- Now there are some events in websocket like "on" and "emit"
- When we are using emit we are triggering an event
- When we are using on we will User handler or a listener
- emit -> this event(with some data)
- on -> this event(receive some data)
- for e.g.: 
    on server side -  io.emit(event1,"Hi")
    on client side - socket.on(event1,(data)=>{})
- broadcast => event1(data);
-to :  for individual message => socket.to().emit()
-join : new room and multiple people(to join people in a room) => socket.join(room1)
